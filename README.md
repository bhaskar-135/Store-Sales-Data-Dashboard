# Store-Sales-Data-Dashboard
Using a store sales dataset obtained from Kaggle, I created an insightful and interactive dashboard in Microsoft Excel to analyze and visualize key sales metrics. The dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive view of the data, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

The Excel dashboard transformed raw sales data into an intuitive, actionable format, enabling stakeholders to:

Monitor performance trends over time.

Quickly identify areas of opportunity or concern.

Make informed strategic decisions to optimize sales and operations.

By using Excelâ€™s versatile tools and visualizations, the project successfully bridged the gap between data and decision-making, ensuring accessibility and usability for non-technical users.
